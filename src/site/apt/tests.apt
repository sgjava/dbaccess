Functional tests

    Unit tests are provided to test all the basic functionality. You can really
    think of these more as integration tests since each test handles a complete
    functional section of database work.

    * {{{./testapidocs/com/codeferm/dbaccess/BaseTest.html}BaseTest}} is the parent
      test of all other tests. It handles acquiring application properties and
      SQL statements.

    * {{{./testapidocs/com/codeferm/dbaccess/dbcp/BaseDbcpTest.html}BaseDbcpTest}}
      is the parent of all DBCP based tests. It handles acquiring a
      DataSource based on BasicDataSource. All child classes test
      implementation specific JDBC wrappers against DBCP pooled connections.

    * {{{./testapidocs/com/codeferm/dbaccess/atomikos/BaseAtomikosTest.html}BaseAtomikosTest}}
      is the parent of all Atomikos based tests. It handles acquiring a
      DataSource based on AtomikosDataSourceBean. All child classes test
      implementation specific JDBC wrappers against Atomikos.

    * {{{./testapidocs/com/codeferm/dbaccess/transaction/TransactionTest.html}TransactionTest}}
      Is used by all transaction tests to verify commit and rollback on
      @Transaction annotated methods. Standard Connection and JTA based
      connections are tested.
